                                I worked in the Ford Lab at Emory University to determine the efficacy of Lulizumab, an anti-CD28 domain antibody, at reducing graft rejection rates compared to the current standard of care: calcineurin inhibitors. I analyzed flow cytometry data to determine the likely mechanism of action of anti-CD28 domain antibodies using expression of cellular markers and developed a pipeline for flow cytometry analysis using unsupervised machine-learing algorithms in conjuction with traditional manual gating methods. I was sponsored to present my research at Experimental Biology 2020. </span>
